            <h3>üè® Hotel Management System</h3>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, AWS</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I developed a comprehensive hotel management system using Spring Boot, with role-based access for Admin, Manager, and Employee roles. The system supports secure CRUD operations for managing staff and tasks, using MySQL for data storage and full API documentation in Swagger. I implemented Spring Security to ensure data protection and access control based on roles.</p>

            <h3>üìö Digital Library Web Application</h3>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> C#, ASP.NET, MVC, SMSS</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Developed a comprehensive web-based library system supporting online book purchasing, borrowing, and dynamic inventory management. Implemented user authentication, password recovery, automated notifications, and waitlist handling. Integrated Entity Framework with SQL Server for efficient data management, emphasizing secure, user-friendly design.</p>

            <h3>ü§ñ Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning</h3>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Developed a sophisticated project for the "Introduction to Machine Learning" course, focusing on predicting heart attack risk based on various health attributes in a dataset. Implemented the project in Python using pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for model development. Evaluated multiple machine learning models to determine the most accurate for predicting the target variable, which is the increased risk of a heart attack.</p>

            <h3>üî¨ Wafer Defect Detection using Deep Learning</h3>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Developed a deep learning solution for detecting potential scratch defects on silicon wafer dies in semiconductor manufacturing. Used advanced feature engineering with KDTree algorithms to analyze spatial relationships between dies, computing neighbor statistics within different radii. Built a feedforward neural network (MLP) with dropout regularization that achieved ~93% accuracy on ~5 million dies. The model classifies each die as defective or non-defective, helping improve production quality and reduce manufacturing costs in real-world scenarios.</p>

            <h3>üì± BookiT: Book Lending App for Students</h3>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Java, Android Studio, Firebase, Google Services</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Developed an innovative Android application that revolutionizes the library experience for students. BookiT allows students to search and borrow physical books from the library with just one click, streamlining the entire borrowing process. The app features a clean, user-friendly interface with book search functionality and instant borrowing capabilities. Books are automatically prepared for pickup at the library, saving students time and making the process more efficient. Integrated with Google Firebase for real-time data management and user authentication.</p>
